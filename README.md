# Project tracker!

### This project was built with React + Vite

## The app currently has:

- 📝 You can add projects
- ⏳ Timer for tracking how much time we spend working on the projects
- 👤 Basic user login and logout system
- 📋 Menu that displays the amount of project your user has
- ⏱️ A display with all the other timers you have for that project
- ☁️ Firebase cloudbase

## This is a work in progress! The final app should have:

- Firebase cloud storing
- Firebase authentication (to log in with your google account)
- CRUD for adding projects, modifying their name and deleting projects
- Timer for tracking how much time we spend working on the projects
- Graphics for displaying the data for each project (with react chart)

## Cool things we could add in the future:

- Posibility of check a project for completion, that archives it
- Access to your archives/completed projects
- Posibility of adding an optional "task" input to each timer, to keep track of which timer corresponds to what task
- Posibility of deleting specific timers for a project
